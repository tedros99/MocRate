# MocRate: A Portable Pulse Oximeter

## Detecting a patientâ€™s heart rate and oxygen is a very common practice in the medical world. Due to this, a solution for a portable and user friendly monitor for efficient use is crucial.  In this project, we have designed and deployed a battery-powered and portable sensor that can quickly get an individuals heart rate by them simply placing their finger into a clip that measure their heart rate and oxygen levels and provide them that information quickly and clearly.

## Components
1. SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor -MAX30101 & MAX32664 (~42.50 USD)
2. Arduino Uno Rev3 (~25.29 USD)
3. AA Batteries (~3.00 USD)
4. AA Battery Holder (~6.48 USD for 6)
5. Waveshare 4.2inch E-Ink Display (~34.99 USD)
6. Power Button (~2.00 USD)
7. 3D Printed Chassis (Price Varies)
