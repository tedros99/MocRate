1. This project is a portable heart rate and pulse oximeter to measure the vitals of the user and display them on an energy-efficient electronic ink display. It will utilize a pulse oximeter breakout board from sparkfun to measure the vitals of the patient, which will then be displayed on the waveshare 4.2 inch e-ink display.
2. We aim for this monitor to be battery-powered by AA batteries (that can be recharged.) The end product will be a comfortable size that can be easily held by average human
hands. Additionally, it will be lightweight and trivial to carry around for the userâ€™s needs. The accuracy of the monitor to be as accurate as the breakout board, the SparkFun Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor, allows us to. According to the design specifications, it is high fidelity and the margin of error is minimal.
